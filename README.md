# Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Maze Generation

*Abstract*:

## Research Questions

1) How can adversarial reinforcement learning be used to generate high-quality mazes?
2) How does this approach compare to classical procedural maze algorithms (DFS, Prim’s, Kruskal’s)?
3) What reward functions encourage meaningful maze complexity?
4) How does coevolution between the Generator and Solver impact performance?

## Comparative Results

We evaluated our adversarial reinforcement learning approach through a comparative experiment against established maze 
generation techniques (Prim’s, Depth-First Search, and Random Maze Generation).  Mazes generated by our Deep Q-Network 
(DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agents were assessed for solvability, difficulty, and triviality. We 
generated 100 mazes using each method, calculating metrics such as average steps to solution and solvability rate to 
benchmark performance. Implemented in Python with PyTorch and NumPy, the experiments leveraged a state space of size 
128x4 (for a 15x15 maze) and an action space of four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), utilising a 
GPU-accelerated system for efficient training and generation.

| Method     | Maze Size | Average Steps to Solution | Solvability Rate | Triviality | Difficulty |
|------------|-----------|---------------------------|------------------|------------|------------|
| DFS        |           |                           |                  |            |            |
| Prim       |           |                           |                  |            |            |
| RMG        |           |                           |                  |            |            |
| DQN (Ours) |           |                           |                  |            |            |
| PPO (Ours) |           |                           |                  |            |            |
